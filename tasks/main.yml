# Idempotent way to build a /etc/hosts file with Ansible using your Ansible hosts inventory for a source.
# Will include all hosts the playbook is run on.
# Inspired from http://xmeblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/ansible-dynamicaly-update-etchosts.html

# This include_vars allows you to keep your vaulted variables outside of your main repo
# It assumes the PRIVATE_REPO environment variable is set to the path of your private repo
# On home-infra, this is done by firstrun.sh.
# However, this role will not break if you do not have these
